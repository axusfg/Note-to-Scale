**On September 1, 2017, one million Russian students watched as Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the nation. In his speech, President Putin declared:**

“Artificial intelligence is the future for all humankind… whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.”

In January of 2018, the United States National Defense Strategy identified AI as a key technology to “ensure [the U.S.] will be able to fight and win the wars of the future.” Emerging technologies in AI are transforming the interactions between state actors by creating new means of diplomacy and war. Seizing on the opportunities arising from AI technology is crucial for Russia to remain competitive against its global rivals, notably the United States and China. Investing in AI is not only critical for Russia to compete against the West, but also valuable for Russia to maintain order and security at home and achieve foreign objectives abroad. With the ability to shape geopolitical conflicts both at home and abroad, artificial intelligence will become an increasingly important topic for Russia’s national security in this decade and beyond.

Although there is no consensus around a singular definition to encompass the term “artificial intelligence,” the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the Development of Artificial Intelligence defines artificial intelligence as “a set of technological solutions that makes it possible to simulate human cognitive functions, as well as to obtain results during the performance of specific tasks that are at least comparable to the results of human intellectual activity.” For the purposes of consistency, the definition provided by the Russian government will be the one utilized within this essay when discussing AI and its related technologies.

Beginning around 2010, AI became increasingly important following the development and improvement of three core elements: big data, machine learning, and computer processing power. As computing power increased, AI programs became capable of processing high volume information assets. In order for these systems to learn and build large data sets correctly, hundreds of millions of processed images must first be correctly labeled by humans. With greater amounts of accumulated data, computers were able to create mathematical algorithms that allowed them to learn without explicit programming. In short, automated systems began to learn directly from data to complete complicated tasks. The establishment and development of its infrastructure will allow AI systems to develop quickly and play significant roles in all aspects of life.

Political opportunities arising from AI technology are important to Russia’s national security because Russia’s failure to adapt to the technology may hinder the country’s ability to compete as a global power, while the U.S. and China continue to grow in influence due to their ability to better utilize new technologies to project strength. This deficiency is highly detrimental towards Russia’s long-term strategic interests. Specifically, falling behind China and the U.S. in technological development impairs Russia’s desire to expand its influence and become a regional hegemony in a multi-polar system. In Russia’s National Security Strategy of 2015, the doctrine explicitly states that a long-term national strategic goal of Russia is “consolidating the Russian Federation’s status as a leading world power in a polycentric World. Russian President Vlaidimir Putin has reinforced this idea, claiming that a “unipolar model is unacceptable,” given its potential to “destabilize international relations.”

To this end, advancing AI and correctly managing its technologies is absolutely essential for Russia to play a greater role in the international community as a global power. According to Professor Horowitz of the University of Pennsylvania:

“Artificial intelligence can influence economic power and societies around the world [and] innovation could have large-scale consequences for the global balance of power.”

Yet, despite the well-known potential of AI to transform power dynamics between states, Moscow’s development still lags far behind its peers like China and the United States. Russia’s deficient progress in investment and development of AI compared to its peers can be found by examining both its private sector and the military. While classified information regarding Russia’s spending on AI is unknown, public data shows that its annual domestic investment in this area was around 700 million rubles, or $12.5 million in 2017. Although Russia is making efforts to close the gap — most recently with the release of its national strategy for the development of artificial intelligence in October of 2019 — other countries have established far more ambitious (yet realistic) goals. Military investment on AI technology varies between nations, yet the U.S. and China both easily exceed Russia in this sector. The U.S. Department of Defense already spends $7.4 billion annually on unclassified research of AI, while China plans to foster a $1 trillion A.I. industry by 2030. It should be noted, however, that Russia’s true military expenditure is predicted to be about triple their public defense budget.

Despite data pointing to Russia’s lack of progress in AI, proponents optimistic about Russian military development in this area point towards the government’s 10-point agenda. Among other initiatives, the agenda calls for “the establishment of an AI and Big Data consortium, a state-backed AI training and education program, a dedicated AI lab, and a National Center for Artificial Intelligence.” However, analysts have noted that the initiatives are simply aspirations of the Kremlin, rather than specific policy goals. As a result, the ambiguity surrounding the initiatives will “result in overlapping responsibilities and bureaucratic inertia, hindering AI development rather than accelerating it.” In the Russian private sector, the country does not fare any better. Among other factors, systemic corruption and increasingly intrusive government regulations have created a struggling business environment in Russia. While the West boasts “venture capital availability, IPOs, and an investment climate similar to that in Silicon Valley,” Russia lacks a similar “start-up” culture necessary to create technological breakthroughs. The relatively poor business environment of Russia is best reflected through comparisons with other nations; not a single Russian city, including the Skolkovo Innovation Center in Moscow — Russia’s “response” to Silicon Valley — was listed as a top 20 global regional hub for the AI sector in 2018. On the other hand, Chinese AI startups received 48% of global AI venture funding, while the United States is home to the world’s highest number of AI companies.

The lack of funding and lack of a supportive culture for further innovation are systemic issues that present a threat to the Kremlin. In Russia’s National Security Strategy of 2015, the doctrine acknowledges that “an ineffective system for encouraging activity in the spheres of science and innovation” creates “laggardness in the development of high technologies.” The results of such deficiencies are far-reaching; Russian academics have produced “few research papers on AI” and the “Russian technology industry has yet to produce AI applications that are on par with those produced by the United States and China.”

On the topic of competing for global influence, investments in AI are also significant in the way in which nations such as the United States, China, and Russia “export models [liberal democracies, digital authoritarian, and hybrid regimes, respectively] for influence over swing states.” In particular, AI technology enables global powers to export “domestic [forms of digital] political regime types” to swing states through surveillance and control systems. A swing state is defined as a nation that may “plausibly tend towards or lend support to the different models” of governance. In this arena, nations that are well-equipped with AI technology can project their influence by enabling swing states to adapt to their preferred system. Vietnam and Thailand has already emulated China’s Great Firewall approach, and Chinese firms have supplied “wearable cameras with artificial intelligence powered facial-recognition technology” to Malaysia and Singapore. Even Russia recognizes the connection between foreign investment and politics. Although intended to criticize American influence, Russia has stated that “individual states utilize economic methods and instruments of investment and technological policy to resolve their own geopolitical tasks.” If Russia were to become capable of developing and exporting AI-technology, Putin would be able to promote authoritarian control abroad and serve to legitimize its own form of an illiberal democracy at home. In short, AI can create opportunities for nations to utilize its technology as a means to expand influence on a global stage. Likewise, the failure to invest and cultivate an environment for scientific advancement in the field will leave Russia at a disadvantage compared to its political rivals.

Beyond the ability for AI to affect power dynamics, the weaponization of artificial intelligence for political purposes creates both opportunities and challenges pertaining to Russia’s national security. In this following paragraphs, all benefits that Russia may receive from utilizing artificial intelligence are written under the assumption that Russia continues to develop the necessary infrastructure to support the technology. However, even under current circumstances, Russia can stand to benefit by utilizing AI as an enabler to their current operations.

Disinformation Campaigns

Russia recognizes that countries may exploit and “utilize information technologies to achieve their geopolitical objectives, including by manipulating public awareness and falsifying history.” Russia utilizes disinformation campaigns because they are a low-cost, yet highly effective way to “degrade public trust in media and state institutions” and “amplify social division, resentment, and fear.”

Perhaps most prominently, Russia’s disinformation campaign against the United States during the 2016 Presidential Election reached over 126 million people on Facebook and 20 million more on Instagram. In fact, Russia’s disinformation campaigns have been deployed throughout the world, targeting Western European countries, Latin American nations, and former Soviet states such as Ukraine.

Given that Russia is in an unfavorable position in the global competition for AI technology, combining elements of AI with disinformation campaigns remains a low-cost, high-impact offensive alternative. With limited capabilities, “the Kremlin can quickly gain comparative advantage in AI-driven information warfare, leaving the West to once again be caught off guard.” With developments in artificial intelligence, there will be new opportunities for Russia to create and disseminate even more effective, and powerful, disinformation. AI has the potential to “hyperpower Russia’s use of disinformation,” where “the United States and Europe are ill-equipped to respond to AI-driven asymmetric warfare in the information space.” Utilizing AI in its disinformation campaigns would therefore reinforce Russia’s commitment to utilize “information measures to ensure strategic deterrence and protect [Russia’s] sovereignty and territorial integrity.”

One way in which AI can affect disinformation is by using the technology to amplify the rate of such attacks with lower costs. With AI, less manpower is necessary because “rather than hire human workers to write and distribute propaganda, organizations could lean on machines to compose believable and varied content at tremendous scale.” Since the technology is scalable by nature, Russia can “increase the number of actors who can afford to carry out particular attacks” and “gain the ability to carry them out at a much higher rate.” Throughout its entire disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, the Kremlin only spent around 95 million rubles, or $95,000. In other words, disinformation campaigns are relatively cheap and the development of AI may incentivize Russia to increase its attacks “from the standpoint of prioritization or cost-benefit analysis.”

Machine Learning and Micro-targeting Content

Furthermore, the use of AI will also expand the ability for its user to “micro-target” to the electoral. The practice of microtargeting is to deliver narrowly-tailored messages to a certain demographic of people.

Sophisticated AI systems may perfect microtargeting by enabling groups to “target precisely the right message at precisely the right time in order to maximize persuasive potential.” Improvements in microtargeting pose new risks and possibilities for Russia’s national security. From a domestic perspective, Russia may use AI systems to identify and target undecided voters, and promote a certain political agenda. “Automated, hyper-personalised disinformation campaigns” may be used to “affect voting behavior” by targeting those in “swing districts” with political advertisement or disinformation.

Beyond AI’s ability to improve the identification of key populations, or those who are most likely to engage or be influenced by propaganda, the technology may also “vary the details of the attack for each target.”

Since these systems require large amounts of data, the accumulation and utilization of large data sets will allow for the content of disinformation to be automatically altered depending upon the recipient. These opportunities are likely to present themselves in the near future, since propaganda and disinformation are becoming “increasingly customized and personalized to appeal to and manipulate specific users.”

Assuming that political stability from the perspective of the Russian state is defined as ensuring the current kleptocratic system with the same political actors in power, improvements in AI-assisted microtargeting may be considered a “mechanism for cooperation between the state and civil society” and utilized to “strengthen political stability.” From a foreign perspective, the techniques of AI-supported microtargeting may also be used in its disinformation campaigns abroad to “expand the threat of social manipulation.” For instance, in 2016, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Kremlin-tied company engaged in disinformation campaigns, “specifically targeted black American communities.” In its efforts to “exacerbate existing divisions,” Russia attempted to target specific groups with specific messages, oftentimes with contradictory viewpoints. The IRA created websites and content focusing on both the Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter movement. These operations exploited existing “racial conflict in the United States” and “sought to stir ethnic strife” in other countries. With AI-backed microtargeting, disinformation campaigns will become more specific and effective.

While AI is an enabler to offensive measures, Russia’s lack of investment also leads to vulnerabilities. In Russia’s Doctrine of Information Security, Russia acknowledges that its current “level of dependence of the domestic industry on foreign information technologies remains high.” This statement also applies to its development of cyber infrastructure. As previously noted, Russia’s inability to create domestic infrastructure will leave it vulnerable to potential counterattacks by adversaries. For instance, the U.S. Cyber Command conducted operations on the IRA during the 2018 U.S. Midterm Elections, which effectively cut Internet access from the troll factory. While small in scale, if other nations utilize disinformation campaigns — supported by AI systems — against Russia, the Kremlin may find itself in a difficult position to prevent such attacks themselves. Such scenarios would pose a direct threat to Russia’s interest in ensuring the “circulation of reliable information” (or as reliable as Putin sees fit), which Russia views as crucial to “guarantee the national security of the Russian Federation.”

Recognizing the political consequences of artificial intelligence, many nations are competing to develop the infrastructure and understand the true scope of the technology. No longer contained to the software engineers of Silicon Valley, artificial intelligence has the ability to affect the global political landscape. The opportunities of artificial intelligence poses a national security threat to Russia because it may hinder (or help) Russia’s ability to become a hegemonic power in global affairs and influence the Kremlin’s ability to affect political stability at home and abroad. With growing involvement (and competition) from the international community, the Kremlin must take immediate action to adapt and develop artificial intelligence as a means to promote and ensure Russia’s national security.
